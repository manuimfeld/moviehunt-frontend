        <p>
          Moana is a sea-loving, strong-willed wayfarer. Though she has moments
          of self-doubt, she has great pride in who she is, and doesnâ€™t back
          away from new challenges. She approaches new experiences and tasks
          with the utmost seriousness and will stand her ground to fight for
          what she values, even when all seems lost.
